// Constructors

// Constructors are special methods that are run every time a new instance of a class is created

class Machine {
	
	// Constructors always have to have the same name as the class
	// They have no return type, void, String, double, boolean etc.
	
	public Machine() {
		System.out.println("COnstructor Running!");
	}
	
}

public class App {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Machine machine1 = new Machine();
	}
}
